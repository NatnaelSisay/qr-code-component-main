## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to vertially align items in grid layout.

```css
.card {
	display: grid;
	justify-items: center; /* Horizontaly center*/
	align-content: start; /* Don't steach when height of card increase*/
}
```

### Continued development

I think i understood grid but it is not battle tested enough an i belive i should work on more complex layout using grid.

### Useful resources
